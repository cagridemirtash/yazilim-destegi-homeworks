- This example includes I/O operations, also arrays and loops.
- We want to calculate harmonic average towards to given array by user.
- First of all, user interact to program and give inputs.
- And then, take the parameters and send to method "calculateHarmonicAverage".
- Finally, calculate harmonic number for each element of array.
- Return the result.
