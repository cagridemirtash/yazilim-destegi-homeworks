# Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize Array
2. Control index which is divided by 3.
3. If divided without remainder, fill specific action executed (You will see in the [Main.java](Main.java)).
4. If divided with remainder, fill with blank space and add " * " start and end of the col. Also add blank space if index is not 0 or 3.
5. Print the whole array which is filled by specific rules.
